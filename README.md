Week 1:
---------
First of all we started with working on simple languages 
such as HTML,CSS and Javascript which we are already familiar with.
We did some mini projects such as static web pages and styling them using CSS Elements 
and Javascript Elements.

Week 2:

Next We focused on the framework called React which is basically a Javascript Library which 
is very usefulk in development of front-end of Blockchain applications.We used JSX , Vanilla 
JavaScript and made some responsive webpages and styled it using CSS.
The purpose of React is to making it easy for integrating front end of web app with solidity.
The mini-projects which are done here are stored in the online editor. I will be uploading the projects 
shortly once I finish dcownloading them from the website.
This was completely done on SCRIMBA.I couldnt find my downloaded files and I have logged in as 
an anonymous user in SCRIMBA :(
Ill try to upload the projects in this github repo only.
